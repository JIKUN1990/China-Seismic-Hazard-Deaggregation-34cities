# China-Seismic-Hazard-Deaggregation-34cities
Qualification of the dominant earthquake scenarios that have the most contribution to the seismic hazard for main cities in China. After utilizing the CPHSA scheme to construct the China hazard map by OQ platform, the results of deaggregation for PGA, Sa(0.2s, 0.3s, 0.5s, 0.7s, 1.0s, 1.5s, 2.0s), corresponding to Mean Return Periods (MRPs) of 475-yr and 2475-yr, for 34 main cities in China were calculated.
